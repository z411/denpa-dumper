dempa-dumper
============

Simple perl script to dump links of a Mediafire folder in a text file or HTML file.

Requirements
------------
* LWP::Simple
* JSON

TODO
----
It's currently very hardcoded, so the idea is to

* Work recursively
* Command line arguments for the folder name, sort and output type (text/HTML)
